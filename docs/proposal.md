# Project Proposal

## Title
**Authors:** Tianyou Zhang, Akira van de Groenendaal

**URL:** https://ak33ra.github.io/15-418-final-project/

## Summary

We are going to investigate the effects of multiple models inhabiting the same GPU. We will look at how performance metrics such as throughput, latency, slowdown, and load change as a function of number and size (batches, parameter count, etc) of models. Another question to think about is which models benefit or suffer more from this setup?
