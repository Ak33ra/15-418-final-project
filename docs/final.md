# Final Report

## Summary
The goal of our project was to examine how multi tenancy on GPUs affected model performance, and if there were any exploitable patterns.

---

## Background

---

## Approach
We tested how running multiple models affected key metrics: latency, throughput, and GPU utilization.


---

## Results
There is a reduciton in throughput and increase in latency as we add more models onto the GPU.
