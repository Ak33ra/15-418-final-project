## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Set up the environment with conda: `conda env create -f environment-yaml` 
3. Activate with `conda activate mps-multitenant`
4. Treat `src` as a package by running `pip install -e .` in the root directory with the conda env active
5. From anywhere, you can use `from multitenant import _` to access source code and run scripts/analysis

Alternatively to conda, you can install the env using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
